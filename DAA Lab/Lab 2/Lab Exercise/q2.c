// Write a program to find out GCD (greatest common divisor) using the following three

// a) Euclidâ€™s algorithm
// b) Consecutive integer checking algorithm.
// c) Middle school procedure which makes use of common prime factors. For finding

// Write a program to find out which algorithm is faster for the following data. Estimate

// each case.
// i. Find GCD of two numbers when both are very large i.e.GCD(31415, 14142) by
// applying each of the above algorithms.
// ii. Find GCD of two numbers when one of them can be very large i.e.GCD(56,
// 32566) or GCD(34218, 56) by applying each of the above algorithms.
// iii. Find GCD of two numbers when both are very small i.e.GCD(12,15) by applying
// each of the above algorithms.
// iv. Find GCD of two numbers when both are same i.e.GCD(31415, 31415) or
// GCD(12, 12) by applying each of the above algorithms.
// Write the above data in the following format and decide which algorithm is faster for
