Write a program to implement Fractional KnapSack problem using Greedy method.


Items as (value, weight) pairs
arr[] = {{60, 10}, {100, 20}, {120, 30}}
Knapsack Capacity, W = 50
Output: Maximum possible value = 240
Explanation: by taking items of weight 10 and 20 kg and 2/3 fraction of 30 kg.
Hence total price will be 60+100+(2/3)(120) = 22 0
