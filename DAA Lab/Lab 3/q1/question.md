Write a program to search an element x in an array of n integers using binary search algorithm that uses divide and conquer technique. Find out the best case, worst case and average case time complexities for different values of n and plot a graph of the time taken versus n. The n integers can be generated randomly and x can be choosen randomly, or any element of the array or middle or last element of the array depending on type of time complexity analysis.
