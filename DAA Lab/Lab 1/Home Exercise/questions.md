## Home Exercise

**1.** [Write a program to find out the second smallest and second largest element stored in an array of n integers. n is the user input. The array takes input through random number generation within a given range. How many different ways you can solve this problem. Write your approaches & strategy for solving this problem.](q1.c)

**2.** [Write a program to swap pair of elements of an array of n integers from starting. If n is odd, then last number will be remain unchanged.](q2.c)

**3.** [Write a program to display an array of n integers (n>1), where at every index of the array should contain the product of all elements in the array except the element at the given index. Solve this problem by taking single loop and without an additional array.](q3.c)

**4.** [Write a program using a function for computing ⌊√n⌋ for any positive integer. Besides assignment and comparison, your algorithm may only use the four basic arithmetic operations. Hints: In number theory, the integer square root (isqrt) of a positive integer n is the positive integer m which is the greatest integer less than or equal to the square root of n,isqrt(n)=⌊√n⌋](q4.c)
