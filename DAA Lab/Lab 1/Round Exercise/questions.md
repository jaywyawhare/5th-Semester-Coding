## ROUND EXERCISE

**1.** [Assume that you are given a rudimentary programming language which contains only four operators, viz., +, −, abs and div. + and − have their usual meanings, while div(a, b) returns the quotient of a/b and abs(a) returns the absolute value of a. Write a program to solve this problem by using a function max(a, b) that takes two integers a and b as inputand returns the maximum of the two. Note that you can only use the operators provided;in particular, the constructs ”if”, “while”, or “for” are not available](q1.c)
