# Design and Analysis of Algorithms Lab - 1

## LAB Exercise

**1.** [Write a program to store random numbers into an array of n integers and then find out the smallest and largest number stored in it. n is the user input.](q1.c)

**2.** [Write a program to store random numbers into an array of n integers, where the array must contains some duplicates. Do the following:<br>a) Find out the total number of duplicate elements.<br>b) Find out the most repeating element in the array.](q2.c)

**3.** [Write a program to rearrange the elements of an array of n integers such that all even numbers are followed by all odd numbers. How many different ways you can solve this problem. Write your approaches & strategy for solving this problem.](q3.c)

**4.** [Write a program that takes three variable (a, b. c) as separate parameters and rotates the values stored so that value a goes to be, b, b to c and c to a by using SWAP(x,y) function that swaps/exchanges the numbers x & y.](q4.c)

**5.** [Let A be n*n square matrix array. WAP by using appropriate user defined functions for the following:<br>a) Find the number of nonzero elements in A<br>b) Find the sum of the elements above the leading diagonal.<br>c) Display the elements below the minor diagonal.<br>d) Find the product of the diagonal elements.](q5.c)
