Write a program to use divide and conquer method to determine the time required to find the maximum and minimum element in a list of n elements. The data for the list can be generated randomly. Compare this time with the time taken by straight forward algorithm or brute force algorithm for finding the maximum and minimum element for the same list of n elements. Show the comparison by plotting a required graph for this problem.
