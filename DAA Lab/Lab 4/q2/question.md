Write a program to sort a list of n elements using the merge sort method and determine the time required to sort the elements. Repeat the experiment for different values of n and different nature of data (random data, sorted data, reversely sorted data) in the list. n is the user input and n integers can be generated randomly. Finally plot a graph of the time taken versus n.
