Given n elements input through keyboard, write a program that prints the length of the longest increasing subsequence whose adjacent element difference is one.
Exact Input/output Sample-1
Enter maximum size of array: 10
Enter 10 integers (separated by space): 3 10 3 11 4 5 6 7 8 12 The longest increasing subsequence whose adjacent element differs by one: {3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8) 
The length of increasing subsequence: 6

Exact Input/output Sample-2
Enter maximum size of array: 8
Enter 8 integers (separated by space): 6 7 8 3 4 5 9 10 
The longest increasing subsequence whose adjacent element differs by one: { 6, 7, 8, 9, 10} The length of increasing subsequence: 5
