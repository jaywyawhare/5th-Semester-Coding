Given an array of n integers, n is input through keyboard. The problem is to find the length of the subsequence in the given array such that all the elements of the
subsequence are sorted in increasing order and also they are alternately odd and even.
Exact Input/output Sample-1
Enter maximum size of array: 6 Enter 6 integers (separated by space): 5 6 9 4 7 8 The longest increasing odd-even subsequence: {5, 6, 7, 8; The length of odd-even increasing subsequence: 4
Exact Input/output Sample-2
Enter maximum size of array: 10 Enter 6 integers (separated by space): 1 12 2 22 5 30 31 14 17 11 The longest increasing odd-even subsequence: {1, 2, 5, 30, 31} or {1, 2, 5, 14, 17} The length of odd-even increasing subsequence: 5
