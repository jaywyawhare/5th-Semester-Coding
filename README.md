# 5th Semester Coding

Welcome to the 5th Semester Coding repository! This repository contains the code for my 5th semester coursework, including assignments, lab work, and projects for various subjects. The semester focuses on topics such as Computer Networks (CN) and Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA).

Each subject has its own directory, further divided into relevant topics and concepts. The root directory contains this README file and the license information.

## Subjects

The 5th semester coursework covers the following subjects:

- Computer Networks (CN) Lab
  The CN Lab directory contains code and resources related to the Computer Networks course. It includes exercises and projects on topics such as TCP/IP, network protocols, Wireshark, client-server architecture, DNS, DHCP, and HTTP.

- Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA) Lab
  The DAA Lab directory contains code and resources related to the Design and Analysis of Algorithms course. It includes exercises and projects on algorithms, data structures, dynamic programming, sorting algorithms, graph algorithms, the knapsack problem, Huffman coding, the longest common subsequence (LCS), the Bellman-Ford algorithm, and Dijkstra's algorithm.
